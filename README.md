# BOOKSATORE-DATABASE-
Bookstore Database Project built in MySQL — includes table creation, joins, aggregate functions, and data analysis queries


:- Overview
This SQL project demonstrates how to design and manage a **Bookstore Database** using **MySQL**.  
It includes database creation, table design, data manipulation, and query execution — covering both **basic** and **advanced SQL concepts**.

---

:- Database Structure
The project contains three main tables:
1. BOOKS – Stores details about each book, including title, author, genre, price, and stock.
2. CUSTOMERS – Contains customer information like name, email, and location.
3. ORDERS – Tracks customer purchases, order dates, quantities, and total amounts.

:- Key SQL Concepts Used
- Database & table creation  
- Primary and foreign keys  
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)  
- Filtering using `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `DISTINCT`  
- Sorting and limiting results (`ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)  
- Joining multiple tables (`JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`)  
- Grouping and summarizing data (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)  
- Using `COALESCE()` for handling null values

:- Query Highlights
Here are some of the tasks covered in this project:
1. Retrieve all books in a specific genre  
2. Find books published after 1950  
3. List customers from a particular country  
4. Calculate total stock and revenue  
5. Display top 3 most expensive fantasy books  
6. Identify the customer who spent the most money  
7. Find the most frequently ordered book  
8. Calculate remaining stock after all orders
